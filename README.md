# Hi

This is one of my project using Reactjs to practice some important concept that i have just learned. This is not a fully finished project, I plan to add more feature in the future, like Forget Password, Task Data Visualization, etc.

## What I Use

- Css module for styling
- Firebase for user authentication and database
- Context to store the logged in user data
- React router
- Fontawesome for icons
